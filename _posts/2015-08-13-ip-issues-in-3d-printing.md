It’s often said that laws don’t always keep pace with technological developments.  This is apparent in the area of 3D printing where there is a convergence of different intellectual property (IP) laws applying at different stages of the printing process.

Adding onto that layer of complexity, the same types of legal issues haunting the entertainment and software industries such as illegal downloading and file-sharing also plague 3D printing.  If you’re interested in 3D printing, CAD design, IP law or if you are just generally a tech geek, Wan Li and Byron will deliver an overview of some of the IP issues that crop up when 3D printing, from protection of original works to the possible dangers of infringement.
